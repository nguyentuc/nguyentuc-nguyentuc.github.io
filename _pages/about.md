I am an PhD student in Computer Science at [Indiana University (IUB)](https://luddy.indiana.edu/index.html), advised by [Prof. Thai Le](https://lethaiq.github.io/tql3/). My research aims to develop innovative methods for enhancing the transparency and interpretability of large language models (LLMs), ensuring their decision-making processes are explainable to both experts and end-users. I also focus on identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities in LLMs, exploring techniques to safeguard against adversarial attacks.

<!-- My research interest lies in the intersection of Interpretability and Explainablity of large-scale models. -->
