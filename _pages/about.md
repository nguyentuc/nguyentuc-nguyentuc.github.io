I am an incoming PhD student in Computer Science at [Indiana University (IUB)](https://luddy.indiana.edu/index.html) from Fall 2024, advised by [Prof. Thai Le](https://lethaiq.github.io/tql3/). Previously, I spent one year at the Department of Computer and Information Science, University of Mississippi.

<!-- My research interest lies in the intersection of Interpretability and Explainablity of large-scale models. -->
