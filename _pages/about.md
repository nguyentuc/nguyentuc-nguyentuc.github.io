I am an incoming PhD student in Computer Science at [Indiana University (IUB)](https://luddy.indiana.edu/index.html) from Fall 2024, advised by [Prof. Thai Le](https://lethaiq.github.io/tql3/). Before my PhD, I spent two years at FPT AI Center as an AI Resident.

My research interest lies in the intersection of Large Language Model and Decision Making.
