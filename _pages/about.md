I am a PhD student in Computer Science at Indiana University (IUB), advised by [Prof.Thai Le](https://lethaiq.github.io/tql3/). Before my PhD, I spent two years at FPT AI Center as an AI Resident.

My research interest lies in the intersection of Large Language Models (LLMs), Parameter-Efficient Finetuning Methods, Decision Making.
